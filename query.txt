  projects = Project.where('client_id = ? AND status = ?', 14, "new")

# ORDER 
ModelName.order('column_name')
# ascending order (0-9, 'A' - 'z', Datewise)
Project.order('start_date')

ModelName.order('column_name DESC')a
Project.order('start_date DESC')

# LIMIT - limits the record to a given number 
..
Project.order('start_date DESC').limit(10)
